# CINEMADDICTED

A website that allows you to do... um... whatever TheMovieDatabase API lets you to do, I don't know yet. The idea is to let user add movies to wishlist, maybe write and read reviews too. We'll see

## commit 1
Nothing really works, API isn't used yet, all there is is some non-functional unfinished pages, which are:
- Welcome page (path '/')
- Movie page (path '/movie/')
- Movie search list (path '/list/')
- Register and login pages (paths '/register/' and '/login')

## What's next?
- Add authentification if possible
- Use TMDB API
- Add wishlist functionality
- Add review functionality if authentification is possible
- idk uuhhhhhhhh ummmmmmmm.... uuuuuuuuhhhhh ummm yyyeahhh ummmm
- welllll ummmmm mhmmmmm..... ummm.... huhhh i uhhhhhh....

## How to launch?
uhh... Run these commands in your console
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
After that you'll see a message with a localhost link. Just visit this link on your website
